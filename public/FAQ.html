</li>
<li>
<a>How do you make money out of this?</a>
<p>“G” is a social project, that isn’t aimed at making profit, but when people or organizations find “G” useful they donate whatever amount is comfortable for them.  However, we welcome and value likeminded partners and friends much more. (Thank you!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<a>How to become a motivator?</a>
<p><b>Very easy!</b></br>
<b>1</b>. Decide on what kind of motivation and support is comfortable for your organization.</br>
<b>2</b>. Crate additional web page starting with “G” (for example, G-Nike.com).</br>
<b>3</b>. Place there all kinds of motivation and support for your potential or current clients!</br>
(Discounts, rewards, presents, Gift cards, testers….) Be as creative as possible, please!</p>
</li>
<li>
<a>What are the benefits of becoming a Motivator?</a>
<p>The potential benefits of joining and motivating millions of G-Players is enormous and is yet to be discovered, however we can surely list the main 3 reasons for joining now:</br>
<b>1</b>. ADVERTISING WITH G-LANDIA IS FREE</br>
(Providing that your products and services correlate with players’ interests, wishes and goals)</br>
<b>2</b>. MARKET SHARE IS ALMOST UNLIMITED</br>  
More than USD 5 TRILLION is being spent by 3 BLN PEOPLE, annually on non-vital things such as: tobacco, alcohol, drugs, unhealthy food, gambling, packaging, wasted energy and water, unneeded luxury and closing and many more.</br>
G-Landia helps its players to become more aware and goal-orientated, swop habits and redirect their spendings into such aspects of lives as: Health, Family, Traveling, Sports, Modern Education, Hobbies, Care, Share, and many other exiting spheres.</br>
So if you are creative enough to motivate people to change their habits & values, you will be rated as their favorite organization, guarantying loyalty and long-term relations.</br>               
<b>3</b>. EVERYTHING HERE IS EASY and GOODWILL</br>
That’s why the way you support chosen audience will always be comfortable for your organization.  It can be any kind of help: discounts, free testers/trials, motivating gifts or your gift cards, or if you are a celebrity, it can be anything from your autograph to inviting the best G-Players to your next concert, match, party or Oscar <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a>What do I do with “G”s (reward points) which I get for succeeding?</a>
<p>It’s is entirely up to your motivators what they will exchange those points for.</br>
Our recommendations are that for every 1 “G” you collect with G-Landia you get a 1% discount for your motivators’ goods and services. So for example, if 3 of your promises (less smoking, alcohol and fat food) have been kept thorough out 7 days, you will collect 21 “G”s. You can then spend that for whatever your motivators have in their G-Stores with a discount of 21 %. (subject to their terms and conditions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<a>What happens when I break my promises and for example, smoke or drink alcohol or eat junk food, etc?</a>
<p>The technique we use in G-Landia is <i>“LOSSES MEAN WINS”</i>.</br>
It has been tested for almost 2 years and has shown fantastic results.</br>
The most common example is when you pick a goal “Not to smoke for 1 year”. We know how uneasy it can be to change habits, so we understand if you give up and occasionally return to your old life.</br>
In order for you to feel good even when you lose, we recommend you to make a symbolic donation every time you spoil your progress and of course get back to your goals as soon you are ready.</br>
So if you smoked, got drunk, lost control and swore at your child unconsciously etc, by supporting for example CANCER RESEARCH GROUP or SAVE THE CHILDREN FUND you actually do <b>GOOD</b> to this world and very soon you will return control of yourself, change you OLD HABITS and get ready for more exciting GOALS in 2017 (G-Landia, Level 2).</br>
You are not alone! Good Luck <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<a>What if I lie to “G”?</a>
<p>At “G” we do everything possible to explore and develop your best human qualities.</br>
We base your success on TRUST and LOVE as oppose to CONTROL and PUNISH.</br>
At the moment we have facts showing that you can only lie for a short period of time to those that trust your every word. So your inevitable honesty will be the best side effect that we can only dream of!</br>
As soon as we find a better technique for you, we will take it onboard immediately!</p>
